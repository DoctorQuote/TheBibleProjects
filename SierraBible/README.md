**The Sierra Bible** is as DESKTOP application. You will need Java 1.6 or greater to enjoy the graphical user interface.


**WARNING:** My favorite scripture set includes:

King's James Old Testament

King's James New Testament

The Book of Mormon


If the thought of reading The Book of Mormon offends, intimidates, or scares, then you will want to use the "[ClassicScriptures](https://github.com/soft9000/TheBibleProjects/tree/main/ClassicScriptures)" project.
