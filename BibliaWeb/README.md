The plans were to share with others on a web site. Godaddy site did not support the Python I needed.

Presently this is the only way I can share it. Very nice web application using Python, HTML5, CSS3, SQLite, Javascript, and Ajax.

Local rev is 2020_08_18_BibliaWeb.

Works great - feel free to re-use.
