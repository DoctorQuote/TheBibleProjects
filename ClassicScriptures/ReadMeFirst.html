This is free software. It is designed to run 
anywhere Java is available.</p>

<p>Our use of Java means that this software 
works great on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and elsewhere. -All we 
need to do to run this software is to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you have >= Java 1.6 installed.</li>
<li>Download the content of this folder.</li>
<li>Click on the *.jar file & let Java do the rest!</li>
</ol>

<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> Some might need to right-click on the above .jar file,
then select the "Run With Java" option from their file manager.</p> <p>Those 
who want to run this program from a terminal or command-line interface 
can do so by simply typing <i>java -jar *.jar</i> from within this folder.
